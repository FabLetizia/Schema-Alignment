# Schema-Alignment
### This is the repository for the Big Data Integration project of the ADVANCED TOPICS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE course. 
The assignment:
Motivated by the topics discussed in class, the goal of this assignment is to study one of the steps involved in the data integration process: Schema alignment, Record Linkage, Data Fusion. Choose one (or more) of them, read recent papers on the subject chosen (including the recent approaches that also leverage the capabilities of LLMs for supporting solutions to these problems), and write a report (around ten pages) describing: (1) the problem, (2) a possible approach (or several, making a comparison), (3) possible improvements of the approach, and (4) how it can be implemented (including a link to a repository with the actual implementation). Optional: if you aim to receive an extra bonus for the evaluation of this assignment, test the approach on a dataset of the DI2KG challenge (http://di2kg.inf.uniroma3.it/2020/#challenge). There is no need to design a method from scratch, you can suggest modifications of the existing approaches.

The project focuses on the Schema alignment phase and the proposed implementation is inspired by the approach proposed in the article: Sheetrit, E., Mishaeli, M., Brief, M., & Elisha, O. (2024). ReMatch: Retrieval Enhanced Schema Matching with LLMs.
